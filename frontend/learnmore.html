        About <span>AI Health</span>
      </h2>

      <p>
        AI Health is an AI-powered early disease risk assessment platform designed
        to assist users in identifying potential health risks at an early stage.
        The system leverages machine learning models trained on publicly available
        medical datasets to analyze symptoms, health indicators, and medical images.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary objective of this project is not to replace medical professionals,
        but to act as a <strong>decision-support tool</strong> that encourages early
        diagnosis and timely medical consultation.
      </p>

      <h3 class="learn-subheading">How the System Works</h3>

      <p>
        Depending on the selected disease, the platform follows two approaches:
      </p>

      <ul class="learn-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Form-based analysis:</strong> For conditions such as diabetes,
          heart disease, and liver disease, users enter relevant health parameters
          like age, glucose level, BMI, and blood pressure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Image-based analysis:</strong> For conditions such as skin cancer,
          brain tumors, and tuberculosis, users upload medical images that are
          analyzed using deep learning models.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="learn-subheading">Technology & Approach</h3>

      <p>
        The backend is designed using modern APIs to process user input and interact
        with trained machine learning models. The frontend provides a clean,
        intuitive interface to ensure ease of use and accessibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Predictions are presented as <strong>risk insights</strong> with confidence
        scores and explanations, allowing users to understand the outcome clearly.
      </p>

      <h3 class="learn-subheading">Ethical Considerations</h3>

      <p>
        AI Health follows responsible AI principles. All predictions are shown as
        preliminary insights and not as confirmed diagnoses. No personal data is
        stored permanently, and patient privacy is prioritized.
      </p>
